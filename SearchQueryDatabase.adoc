=== http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/admin/forests[Creating a forest using Admin Interface]

A forest can be created through the Admin interface by using the Create tab in the Forests section.
To create a forest in a cluster host, go to
http://192.168.99.100:8001 for hostname ml1.local,
http://192.168.99.100:18001 for hostname ml2.local
and
